# Obsidian Doctor

WIP

Creating this since Obsidian, though a great tool, are missing
a few functions that I need.

Primarily the ability to get a list of files that contain a specific tag or are linked from that tag.
Also, the ability to invert that query (i.e. list all files NOT containing or linked from a specific tag).

The use case for this is to quickly split a large set of files into two notebooks, or simply remove all files relating to a specific activity (tag).
